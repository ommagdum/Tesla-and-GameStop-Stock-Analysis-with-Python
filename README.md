## Project Overview
This project explores the following aspects of both companies:

- Data acquisition: Retrieving historical stock price and market data using Python libraries.
- Data cleaning and wrangling: Preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Investigating trends, patterns, and relationships within the data using visualizations and statistical measures.

## Jupyter Notebook
The main analysis is contained in the stock_analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook is divided into sections explaining each step of the workflow:

- Import libraries and data acquisition: Importing necessary libraries and retrieving historical data from a reliable source.
- Data cleaning and preparation: Cleaning and manipulating the data to ensure its quality for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Utilizing various visualizations and statistical tests to understand the data.
- Comparative analysis: Comparing the performance of both stocks across different metrics.
-
